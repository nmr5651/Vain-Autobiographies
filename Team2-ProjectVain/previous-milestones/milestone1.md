## Summary
For scholars to look up Victorian era autobiographies and admins able to update entries as needed.
The summary of the project is to create a database filled with titles, genres, authors, publisher(s), and any other assoicated notes towards the Victorian era autobiographies from Vain. Our group have been supplied with the data of the autobiographies and we will create a database to contain that information.


## Goals
- Normalize database and allow for easy lookup of different autobiographies.
- Admin abilities to edit/update/delete any entries.
- User/Scholar to view and filter for different results based on basic or advanced search options.


## Stakeholders
There are two different stakeholders that would be affected/apart-of of project: Admins and Scholars.
The Admins that will take care of the database entries.
Scholars who will be using the database the view/filter autobiographies.

## Scope
Browse, search, edit database. Scope of database is to allow for scholars to search a large database using a variety of inputs to find the autobiographies they are looking for. As well, it will allow the admins to be able to search/update/delete any entries within the database easily. The scope will not deal with how to find the book's actual location.

## Input
Autobiography, type, author, title, publisher, year, descriptor, named person(s), note(s), located - database attributes.
Allow for partial user input to search for a specific book/genre/etc.
Basic and advanced search option using partial/full input.
For Admins: Form used to collect data from the admin to create a new entry/update an existing one.


## Processing
Scholars searching for autobiographies to be able to search using partial/full input within the search bar. The scholars will be able to select a basic or advanced search. The basic option will allow for any keyword and show different entries using the same keyword. E.x, if the user searched for “Red” it would show different titles/authors/etc that contain those words. For the admins, they will be able to use a form to either create a new entry or update/delete an existing entry within the database. 


## Output
For Admins: Reports option that help with database maintenance such as posible duplicate entry and dirty data. A searchable collection of autobiographies that can be filtered with an array of different inputs(title, author, publisher, year...).  Generated list should give the number of results that  are being displayed.

For Scholars: A searchable collection of autobiographies that can be filtered with an array of different inputs(title, author, publisher, year...).  Collection of autobiographies can be filtered by the “Type” of person the author was, such as a criminal.Generated list should give the number of results that  are being displayed.
